        <p align="center">
            The Solar System is a system of a Sun and the objects that move around it. Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun and everything bound to it by gravity</p>

<h2 align>solar system contain Eight planets </h2>
<ol><li>Mercury</li><li>Venus</li><li>Earth</li><li>mars</li><li> Jupiter</li><li>Saturn</li><li>Uranus</li><li>Neptune</li></ol><br>

<dl><dt><b><u>MERCURY</u></dt><dd></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's a little bigger than Earth's Moon. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter</li></ul><br>
<dl><dt><b><u>VENUS</u></b></dt></dl>
<ul><li>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It's one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it's often called Earth's twin because it's similar in size and density.</li></ul><br>
<dl><dt><b><u>EARTH</u></b></dt></dl>
<ul><li>Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. </li></ul><br>
<dl><dt><b><u>MARS</u></b></dt></dl>
<ul><li>Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.</li></ul><br>
<dl><dt><b><u>JUPITER</u></b></dt></dl>
<ul><li>Jupiter is called a gas giant planet. Its atmosphere is made up of mostly hydrogen gas and helium gas, like the sun. The planet is covered in thick red, brown, yellow and white clouds. The clouds make the planet look like it has stripes</li></ul><br>
<dl><dt><b><u>SATURN</u></b></dt></dl>
<UL><LI>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.</li></ul><br>
<dl><dt><b><u>URANUS</u></b></dt></dl>
<UL><li>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.</li></ul><br>
<dl><dt><b><u>NEPTUNE</u></b></dt></dl>
<ul><li>Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus.</li></ul><br><br>
<h3><b>what is solar system<b></h3>
<p><i>The solar system comprises all the planets that revolve around the sun. The solar system also contains moons, asteroids, comets, minor planets, and different types of gases and dust.

The planets are categorised into two categories: internal planets and outer planets. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupyter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are called inner planets. Earlier, there were nine planets considered till 2006, but now, Pluto does not lie in the list of planets, it does not meet the standard set for the planets.

It is now termed a dwarf planet. In our solar system, the earth is the only planet where life exists. There are many solar systems that exist in the universe, it is more than 500. Our solar system includes the Kuiper belt that lies past Neptuneâ€™s orbit.</i></p><br>
<h4><u><b>WHAT MAKE EARTH SPECIAL</u></b></h4>
<p><i>The Earth is the third planet from the sun. It is also called the blue plane. The Earth is the only planet that supports life because of the availability of air, water, and gases needed for survival. The climate of the Earth is mild. However, due to the overuse and wastage of resources, the planet is in danger, and global warming is increasing. This is affecting the survival conditions for human beings and all living things. In order to save our Earth, we will have to take major steps to conserve what is left on the planet because life is not possible on other planets</i>></p>
